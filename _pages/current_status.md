# Chassis Upgrade
To help with development, the sensors were moved out of the container on to a laser cut acrylic sheet. This enabled easier debugging of the sensors connections and removal of the pi/sensors. The acrylic sheet is held up by custom 3D printed mounts that connect to the metal bars of the chassis. Files for the 3D printed and lasercut parts can be found [here](https://hannabanana96.github.io/MPDR_Project/solidworks/).

## Future Chassis Improvements
* Currently there are only bumpers on the front of the robot. It would be beneficial to add bumpers on the back as well 
* The electronics will requires a more secure enclosure when development begins to come to a close
* There would need to be a sturdy platform so that packages can be placed on the robot
