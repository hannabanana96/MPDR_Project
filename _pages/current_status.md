# Chassis Upgrade
To help with development, the sensors were moved out of the container on to a laser cut acrylic sheet. This enabled easier debugging of the sensors connections and removal of the pi/sensors. The acrylic sheet is held up by custom 3D printed mounts that connect to the metal bars of the chassis. Files for the 3D printed and lasercut parts can be found [here](https://hannabanana96.github.io/MPDR_Project/solidworks/).
