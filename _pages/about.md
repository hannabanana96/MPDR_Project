title: Motivation

One of the greatest challenges we face today is discovering new ways to recycle, repurpose, and reuse items that have been deemed “non-recyclable”. Used medical mobility aids and equipment, such as motorized wheelchairs, fall into this category due to their inability to be re-issued via government agencies and insurance companies. While there are several non-government agencies that are willing to receive used donations, the pre-built mobile infrastructure that comes along with the motorized wheelchair makes it a prime candidate for repurposing. 

In its bare-bones state, a motorized wheelchair is a platform with wheels already built to transport heavy items, usually a person, from point A to point B. Abstracted away from the realm of transporting humans, the nature of the motorized wheelchair base makes it a great proponent for transporting packages in localized areas. With a naturally flat base and the mechanical stability to account for heavy weights, the motorized wheelchair can be repurposed as the foundation of a package delivery robot. In environments such as college campus, downtown metropolises, and suburban neighborhoods, an autonomously operated delivery robot could alleviate the exhaustive and time-consuming task of transporting packages around the area. With the ability to tap into the on-campus WiFi, the robot would have unlimited power to navigate, map, stream live video feed and GPS locations to an easily accessible website. 

# My Role and Purpose
This project is the culmination of my Master's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering degree at Oregon State University. My primary role is the system designer, focusing on the high level design and communication structure, as well as the integration of the lower level components. Two senior level capstone teams assist with the lower level detailed design and implementation.
